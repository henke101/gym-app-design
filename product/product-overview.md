# MbareteGainz

## Description
A lightweight fitness tracking app that uses daily prompts and correlation insights to help users understand how their habits affect their progress. MbareteGainz focuses on simplicity and actionable data rather than overwhelming users with complex metrics.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Tracking fatigue
Most fitness apps require too much data entry, leading to abandoned tracking.

**Solution:** Daily prompts that take under 30 seconds to complete. Simple yes/no questions and quick number inputs keep logging effortless.

### Problem 2: Disconnected data
Users track workouts, meals, and weight separately without understanding how they relate.

**Solution:** Correlation analytics that surface patterns like "You tend to lift heavier after rest days" or "Your weight drops when you log protein consistently."

### Problem 3: Motivation drops
Without visible progress or accountability, users lose motivation after a few weeks.

**Solution:** Streak tracking and progress charts that celebrate consistency and visualize trends over time.

### Problem 4: Information overload
Complex dashboards with dozens of metrics confuse more than they help.

**Solution:** A minimal interface that shows only what matters: today's prompt, recent trends, and key insights.
